# endangered

This is a quick project I made for GLOBAL HACK WEEK: INIT 2023's challenge of creating an Environmental Hack. 
Through this website, I hope to spread more awareness on endagered species, along with what we can do to help them. 
This was made in a couple of hours from scratch to meet the challenge deadline and it's my first hackathon so it's not the best,
but hopefully I can expand on this website in the future! Thank you for reading!
